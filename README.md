# Sand Fly distribution in Brazil Dataset

This repository [Sand fly distribution in Brazil]() contains four files made to show the process of scraping texts from a pdf using Python, tidying the data in Excel and making a dashboard (PowerBI) using professor [Galati's work](https://www.fsp.usp.br/egalati/index.php/2018/07/24/materiais/).

**It's noteworthy that I made a version of the original pdf using only the pages (9-33) in order to streamline the process.**
